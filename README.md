# Face-Recognition-System-Using-OpenCV-
This project demonstrates a real-time face recognition system built using Python's OpenCV library. The system captures video from your camera, detects faces, and matches them with pre-encoded face images stored in a local directory. Recognized faces are highlighted with a bounding box and labeled with their names.
